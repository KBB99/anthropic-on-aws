# Tutorial 4: Architecture Automation (30 minutes) 🏗️

Welcome back! You've mastered agents, hooks, and workflows - now let's build specialized **architecture automation** that creates professional architecture designs and documentation with a single command. In the next 30 minutes, you'll build a complete architecture design system.

## What You'll Build

You're going to create **One-Click Architecture Design** that:
- Analyzes project requirements and makes architectural decisions
- Creates visual architecture diagrams (C4 models)
- Generates Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Produces complete architecture documentation
- Works for any project type (web apps, APIs, microservices, etc.)

## Prerequisites

- ✅ Completed [Tutorial 1: Getting Started with Agents](01-getting-started-agents.md)
- ✅ Completed [Tutorial 2: Automation with Hooks](02-automation-with-hooks.md) 
- ✅ Completed [Tutorial 3: Building Workflows](03-building-workflows.md)
- ✅ Understanding of agent orchestration and workflow commands

## Step 1: Understanding Architecture Automation (5 minutes)

Before building, let's understand what makes architecture automation powerful:

### What Is Architecture Automation?
**Architecture automation combines specialized agents** to handle the complete architecture design process:

```
Project Requirements → Architecture Analysis → Design Decisions → Visual Documentation → ADRs
```

### Architecture Workflow Components
- **Architecture Agent**: Makes structural and technology decisions
- **Documentation Agent**: Creates visual diagrams and specifications
- **Decision Recording**: Generates ADRs with reasoning
- **Template Systems**: Consistent output formats

### Professional Architecture Deliverables
Your automation will produce:
- **System Architecture**: Component structure and relationships
- **C4 Diagrams**: Context, Container, Component, and Code views
- **ADRs**: Architecture Decision Records with reasoning
- **Technology Recommendations**: Specific tool and framework choices
- **Implementation Guidance**: How to build the designed system

---

## Step 2: Create Architecture Specialist Agents (15 minutes)

Let's create two specialized agents for architecture work:

### Create the Architect Agent
```bash
# Copy the architect agent template
cp docs/templates/agents/architect.md ~/.claude/agents/architect.md
```

### Create the Architecture Documenter Agent
```bash
# Copy the architecture documenter agent template
cp docs/templates/agents/architecture-documenter.md ~/.claude/agents/architecture-documenter.md
```

**What just happened?** You created two architecture specialists:
- **Architect**: Makes architectural decisions based on requirements and constraints
- **Architecture Documenter**: Creates professional visual documentation and diagrams

> **💡 Need to view the templates?** The complete agent specifications are available at [docs/templates/agents/architect.md](../../templates/agents/architect.md) and [docs/templates/agents/architecture-documenter.md](../../templates/agents/architecture-documenter.md).

---

## Step 3: Create Architecture Automation Command (8 minutes)

Now let's create a single command that orchestrates complete architecture design:

```bash
# Create commands directory if needed
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands

# Copy the architecture design command template
cp docs/templates/commands/architecture-design.md ~/.claude/commands/architecture-design.md
```

**What does this custom slash command do?** The Architecture Design automation:
- **Analyzes project requirements**: Extracts functional and non-functional requirements
- **Makes architectural decisions**: Selects appropriate patterns and technologies
- **Creates professional documentation**: Generates C4 diagrams and ADRs
- **Provides implementation guidance**: Includes practical next steps

> **💡 Need to see the command details?** The complete command specification is available at [docs/templates/commands/architecture-design.md](../../templates/commands/architecture-design.md).

**Checkpoint**: You now have complete architecture automation that orchestrates specialized agents.

> **⚠️ Important**: After creating new agents and commands, restart Claude Code to load the updated configuration.

## Step 4: Test Your Architecture Automation (2 minutes)

Let's test your complete architecture design system:

### Run Complete Architecture Design
```bash
# Test with a sample project
/architecture-design Build a real-time chat application for teams with file sharing, voice calls, and integrations
```

### Give It Real Tasks
Try these requests to see the architecture automation in action:

> "/architecture-design Create an e-commerce platform for 50,000+ products with real-time inventory and mobile apps and provide complete documentation."

**Expected behavior**: The automation should:
1. Deploy both architect and architecture-documenter agents in parallel
2. Architect analyzes requirements and designs system architecture
3. Architecture-documenter creates professional C4 diagrams
4. Results are coordinated into complete architecture deliverable
5. All documentation follows professional standards

### Test Domain-Specific Architecture
Try this more specific request:

> "/architecture-design Build a fintech trading platform with real-time market data, order execution, and regulatory compliance' focusing on security and performance."

**Expected result**: Each agent provides specialized analysis:
- **Architect**: Financial services architecture patterns with compliance considerations
- **Architecture Documenter**: Professional diagrams showing security boundaries and data flows

**Expected behavior**: Your automation should:
1. Deploy both architect and architecture-documenter agents in parallel
2. Architect analyzes requirements and designs system architecture
3. Architecture-documenter creates professional visual documentation
4. Results are coordinated into complete architecture deliverable
5. All documentation follows professional standards

### Advanced Architecture Usage
Once comfortable with basic architecture design, try these advanced patterns:

> "/architecture-design 'Modernize a legacy monolith serving 1M+ users' and provide migration strategy with risk assessment."

> "/architecture-design 'Design microservices architecture for multi-tenant SaaS platform' with emphasis on scalability and cost optimization."

> "/architecture-design 'Create edge computing architecture for IoT data processing' with real-time analytics requirements."

### Observe Professional Output
Your automation should produce:
- **System Architecture**: Clear architectural decisions with reasoning
- **C4 Diagrams**: Professional visual documentation
- **ADRs**: Architecture Decision Records documenting choices
- **Implementation Guidance**: Practical next steps for development
- **Technology Recommendations**: Specific tools and frameworks

**Success criteria**: Complete, professional architecture design and documentation generated from a single command.

/architecture-design "Your project description here"
```

### Complete Validation
1. **Architecture Analysis**
   - Requirements properly analyzed
   - Architecture pattern appropriate for scale and team
   - Technology choices have clear justification
   **Success criteria**: Architecture decisions are contextual and well-reasoned

2. **Visual Documentation**
   - C4 Context diagram shows system environment
   - C4 Container diagram shows technical building blocks
   - Diagrams are professional and clear
   **Success criteria**: Visual documentation accurately represents architecture

3. **Decision Documentation**
   - ADRs document major architectural decisions
   - Reasoning is clear and considers alternatives
   - Implementation guidance is practical
   **Success criteria**: Decisions are documented with professional justification

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Architecture recommendations seem generic
**Solution**: Ensure project description includes specific requirements, scale, and constraints

**Problem**: Diagrams don't match architectural decisions  
**Solution**: Check that both agents are working with the same project understanding

**Problem**: Missing professional documentation standards
**Solution**: Verify architecture-documenter agent includes C4 and ADR templates

**Problem**: Automation gives generic advice instead of project-specific architecture
**Solution**: Use detailed project descriptions with specific requirements, scale, and use specific prompts like the examples above
