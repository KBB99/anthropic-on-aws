## Step 1: Understanding the EPCC Methodology (8 minutes)

The **EPCC (Explore-Plan-Code-Commit)** methodology provides systematic development workflows:

### The EPCC Phases
```
🔍 EXPLORE → 📋 PLAN → 💻 CODE → ✅ COMMIT
```

Each phase serves a specific purpose and creates documentation for the next phase:

| Phase | Purpose | Key Activities | Output |
|-------|---------|----------------|--------|
| **Explore** | Understand thoroughly before acting | Analyze codebase, identify patterns, document constraints | EPCC_EXPLORE.md |
| **Plan** | Design approach based on exploration | Create implementation plan, identify risks, estimate effort | EPCC_PLAN.md |
| **Code** | Implement with guidance from plan | Write code, follow plan, document decisions | EPCC_CODE.md |
| **Commit** | Finalize with quality assurance | Review, test, document, commit changes | EPCC_COMMIT.md |

### Why EPCC Works for Complex Projects
- **Reduces Risk**: Thorough understanding before implementation
- **Improves Quality**: Systematic approach catches issues early
- **Enables Collaboration**: Clear documentation at each phase
- **Supports Scaling**: Methodology works for projects of any size

### Create EPCC Command Infrastructure
```bash
# Create EPCC command directory
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands

# Copy the EPCC workflow coordinator template
cp docs/templates/commands/epcc.md ~/.claude/commands/epcc.md
```

**What does EPCC do?** The EPCC (Explore-Plan-Code-Commit) methodology:
- **Systematic development approach**: Four phases with specialized agent teams
- **Risk reduction**: Thorough understanding before implementation
- **Quality assurance**: Built-in quality gates at each phase transition
- **Documentation-driven**: Each phase creates documentation for the next

> **💡 Need to see the EPCC details?** The complete workflow specification is available at [docs/templates/commands/epcc.md](../../templates/commands/epcc.md).

## Step 2: Enterprise Team Coordination (10 minutes)

Advanced patterns include coordinating large cross-functional teams:

### Create Cross-Functional Team Orchestration
```bash
# Copy the enterprise review command template
cp docs/templates/commands/enterprise-review.md ~/.claude/commands/enterprise-review.md
```

**What does Enterprise Review do?** The Enterprise Review coordination:
- **Complete team coordination**: All enterprise disciplines working in parallel
- **Comprehensive analysis**: Technical, quality, operational, and business perspectives
- **Cross-functional alignment**: Ensures all concerns are identified and addressed
- **Enterprise compliance**: Meets professional standards and quality requirements

> **💡 Need to see the enterprise review details?** The complete command specification is available at [docs/templates/commands/enterprise-review.md](../../templates/commands/enterprise-review.md).

### Create Enterprise Scaling Patterns
```bash
# Copy the enterprise scaling command template
cp docs/templates/commands/scale-enterprise.md ~/.claude/commands/scale-enterprise.md
```

**What does Enterprise Scaling provide?** The Enterprise Scaling patterns:
- **Multi-dimensional scaling**: Team, process, and technical scaling strategies
- **Agent specialization**: Domain and compliance specialists for different contexts
- **Standardization**: Consistent processes and quality enforcement across teams
- **Success metrics**: Measurable improvements in velocity, quality, and effectiveness

> **💡 Need to see the scaling details?** The complete command specification is available at [docs/templates/commands/scale-enterprise.md](../../templates/commands/scale-enterprise.md).

---

## Step 3: Advanced Agent Orchestration Patterns (5 minutes)

Learn sophisticated patterns for coordinating large numbers of agents:

### Conditional Agent Orchestration
```bash
# Copy the orchestration coordinator agent template
cp docs/templates/agents/orchestration-coordinator.md ~/.claude/agents/orchestration-coordinator.md
```

**What does the Orchestration Coordinator do?** This advanced agent:
- **Context-aware selection**: Analyzes projects and deploys appropriate specialist teams
- **Progressive deployment**: Stages agent deployment based on project maturity
- **Domain-specific teams**: Coordinates agents by business domain and industry
- **Intelligent coordination**: Ensures agents complement rather than duplicate efforts

> **💡 Need to see the orchestration patterns?** The complete agent specification is available at [docs/templates/agents/orchestration-coordinator.md](../../templates/agents/orchestration-coordinator.md).
