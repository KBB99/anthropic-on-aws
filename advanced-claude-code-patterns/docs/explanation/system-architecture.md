## Component Architecture

### 1. Agent Orchestration Layer

**What it is**: Parallel execution of specialized AI agents using the `@agent-name` syntax  
**Why it exists**: Complex development tasks require different types of expertise working simultaneously  
**How it works**: Claude Code can deploy multiple agents concurrently, each with specialized tools and knowledge

#### Agent Orchestration Mechanism

```bash
# Single agent deployment
@docs-tutorial-agent

# Parallel agent orchestration  
@docs-tutorial-agent @docs-howto-agent @docs-reference-agent @docs-explanation-agent

# Cross-functional team deployment
@architect @security-reviewer @qa-engineer @deployment-agent
```

**Execution Model**: When you use `@agent-name` syntax:
1. Claude Code identifies the requested agents
2. Agents are deployed in parallel (not sequentially) 
3. Each agent works with its specialized toolset
4. Results are coordinated and synthesized
5. Conflicts and dependencies are automatically resolved

### 2. Command Controller Layer

**What it is**: Slash commands that orchestrate complex workflows  
**Why it exists**: Provides reusable, parameterized workflows for common development patterns  
**How it works**: Commands coordinate agents, hooks, and external tools to complete multi-step processes

#### Command Architecture Pattern

```markdown
/command-name argument --flag

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              Command Controller                         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 1. Parse arguments and validate preconditions          │
│ 2. Deploy required agents in parallel                  │
│ 3. Coordinate agent interactions                       │
│ 4. Apply lifecycle hooks at appropriate stages         │
│ 5. Integrate with MCP servers if needed               │
│ 6. Synthesize results and provide unified output       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 3. Lifecycle Hook System

**What it is**: Event-driven automation that triggers at specific workflow stages  
**Why it exists**: Ensures consistency, quality, and compliance across all development activities  
**How it works**: Hooks intercept tool usage, command execution, and workflow transitions

#### Hook Event Architecture

```
Development Workflow Events:
  ├── PreToolUse     → Validation and logging before tool execution
  ├── PostToolUse    → Cleanup and audit after tool execution  
  ├── PreCommit      → Quality gates before code commits
  ├── PostCommit     → Notifications and deployment triggers
  ├── PreDeploy      → Security and compliance checks
  └── PostDeploy     → Monitoring and rollback preparation
```

### 4. MCP Integration Layer

**What it is**: Model Context Protocol servers that extend Claude Code capabilities  
**Why it exists**: Enables integration with external systems, databases, and specialized services  
**How it works**: MCP servers provide additional tools and context that agents can use

## System Interaction Patterns

### Pattern 1: Agent-Centric Workflows

Used when tasks require specialized expertise:
```
User Request → Command Controller → Agent Orchestration → Parallel Execution → Result Synthesis
```

### Pattern 2: Hook-Driven Automation

Used when consistency and compliance are critical:
```
Tool Usage → Hook Trigger → Validation/Enhancement → Tool Execution → Hook Cleanup
```

### Pattern 3: External Integration

Used when external systems are required:
```
Agent Request → MCP Server → External System → Data/Service → Agent Processing
```

## Architectural Decisions and Trade-offs

### Why Parallel Agent Execution?

**Decision**: Agents execute in parallel rather than sequentially  
**Rationale**: Development tasks often require different types of analysis simultaneously  
**Trade-off**: Increases complexity but dramatically improves efficiency and quality

### Why Event-Driven Hooks?

**Decision**: Hooks are triggered by events rather than explicitly called  
**Rationale**: Ensures automation is applied consistently without developer overhead  
**Trade-off**: Less direct control but better consistency and compliance

### Why Specialized Agents?

**Decision**: Many focused agents rather than few generalist agents  
**Rationale**: Specialization improves accuracy and allows parallel processing  
**Trade-off**: More components to manage but better results for complex tasks

## Performance Architecture

### Concurrency Model

- **Agent Deployment**: Parallel execution with automatic coordination
- **Hook Processing**: Event-driven with minimal latency overhead  
- **Command Orchestration**: Asynchronous where possible, synchronous for dependencies
- **MCP Integration**: Cached connections with connection pooling

### Scalability Considerations

- **Agent Limits**: System can handle 8-10 concurrent agents effectively
- **Hook Overhead**: Minimal performance impact through efficient event handling
- **Memory Usage**: Agents share context efficiently through Claude Code's memory management
- **Token Optimization**: Specialized agents use fewer tokens than generalist approaches

## Component Selection Decision Framework

### When to Use Agents vs Commands vs Hooks

| Need | Solution | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| Specialized task requiring expertise | **Agent** | Code review, architecture design |
| Multi-step workflow with coordination | **Command** | EPCC workflow, deployment pipeline |
| Automatic quality/compliance enforcement | **Hook** | Pre-commit validation, audit logging |
| External system integration | **MCP Server** | Database access, API integration |

### Component Interaction Rules

1. **Commands orchestrate Agents** - Commands coordinate but agents do the work
2. **Hooks enhance everything** - Hooks can intercept and enhance any component
3. **MCP Servers extend Agents** - Agents use MCP servers for additional capabilities
4. **Agents work in parallel** - Multiple agents can collaborate on complex tasks

## Common Architectural Anti-Patterns

### ❌ Sequential Agent Chains
**Problem**: Deploying agents one after another  
**Solution**: Use parallel deployment with `@agent1 @agent2 @agent3` syntax

### ❌ Monolithic Commands  
**Problem**: Commands that try to do everything internally  
**Solution**: Commands should orchestrate agents, not replace them

### ❌ Hook Overuse
**Problem**: Using hooks for business logic  
**Solution**: Hooks are for automation and validation, not primary functionality

### ❌ MCP Dependency
**Problem**: Making MCP servers required for basic functionality  
**Solution**: MCP servers should enhance capabilities, not provide core features

## Integration Patterns

### Development Workflow Integration

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    Development Lifecycle                           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Plan → Explore → Code → Test → Review → Deploy → Monitor           │
│   │      │       │      │      │        │         │               │
│   ▼      ▼       ▼      ▼      ▼        ▼         ▼               │
│ Agents Commands Hooks  Agents  Agents   Hooks    MCP             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Quality Assurance Integration

```
Code Changes
    ↓
Pre-commit Hooks (Validation)
    ↓  
Agent Review (Analysis)
    ↓
Automated Testing (Verification)
    ↓
Deployment Hooks (Compliance)
    ↓
Production Monitoring (MCP)
```

## Advanced Orchestration Patterns

### Cross-Functional Teams

Deploy agents that represent different roles:
```
@architect @security-reviewer @performance-optimizer @qa-engineer
```

### Workflow Stages

Use commands to coordinate complex multi-stage workflows:
```
/epcc-explore → /epcc-plan → /epcc-code → /epcc-commit
```

### Quality Cascades

Combine hooks with agent reviews:
```
Code Change → Pre-commit Hook → Security Agent → QA Agent → Deploy Hook
```

## Understanding System Behavior

### What Happens During Agent Orchestration

1. **Request Parsing**: Command identifies required agents and their roles
2. **Parallel Deployment**: Agents are started simultaneously with specialized contexts  
3. **Tool Allocation**: Each agent gets appropriate tools for their specialty
4. **Coordination**: Results are automatically coordinated to avoid conflicts
5. **Synthesis**: Final output combines insights from all agents

### What Happens During Hook Execution

1. **Event Detection**: System detects hook trigger (tool use, commit, etc.)
2. **Hook Matching**: Appropriate hooks are identified and prioritized
3. **Validation**: Pre-conditions are checked before main action
4. **Enhancement**: Main action is executed with hook enhancements
5. **Cleanup**: Post-actions ensure consistency and compliance

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. **Start with Single Agents**: Understand individual agent capabilities
2. **Learn Basic Orchestration**: Practice with 2-3 agent combinations  
3. **Implement Essential Hooks**: Add quality and compliance automation
4. **Integrate External Systems**: Add MCP servers for your specific needs
5. **Build Custom Workflows**: Create commands that orchestrate your complete processes
